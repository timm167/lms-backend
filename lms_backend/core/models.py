from .managers import CourseManager, StudentManager, TeacherManager, AdminManager

# Model notes:
# - The User model is a subclass of Djangoâ€™s AbstractUser model.
# - The Student, Teacher, and Admin models are subclasses of User.
# - The Course model represents a course in the LMS.
# - The Lesson model represents a lesson within a course.
# - The Assignment model represents an assignment within a course.
# - The Enrollment model represents a student's enrollment in a course.

# Field types:
# - OneToOneField means that each user can have only one corresponding student, teacher, or admin.
# - ManyToManyField means that a user can be enrolled in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.
# - CharField is a field for storing text data.
# - TextField is a field for storing longer text data.
# - ForeignKey is a field for creating a many-to-one relationship with another model. i.e. Many lessons can belong to one course.
# - URLField is a field for storing URLs.
# - DateTimeField is a field for storing date and time data.
# - IntegerField is a field for storing integer data.

# Other notes:
# - Use cascade delete for related models to ensure data integrity.
# - Use set null as I don't want to delete the course if the instructor is deleted. (Not sure exactly how to handle this yet)

# Future models:
# - Add a model for storing student grades.
# - Add a model for storing student submissions.
# - Add a model for storing cross-course materials.
# - Add a model for storing completed courses.
# - Each enrollment should track the student's progress in the course.
